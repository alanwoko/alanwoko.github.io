I am a Ph.D. student at the University of South Florida, Department of Physics. I am in the Interface and Surface Science Lab (ISSL) under the supervision of [Dr. Matthias Batzill](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t9nQkX4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in applied physics at the University of Lagos, Nigeria with a First Class (Summa Cum Laude). My research interests span different fields in Material Science, Nanotechnology, and Nanoengineering. I am a highly motivated student willing to learn and create an impact by contributing to the body of knowledge that directly/indirectly affects and improves the lives of individuals.

Research
======
I am studying the synthesis and post-growth modification of Two-Dimensional Materials, particularly Two-Dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs), and their many properties. TMDs have numerous potential applications from renewable energy to quantum computers, etc.
